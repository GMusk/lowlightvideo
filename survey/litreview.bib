abstract = {Abstract To utilize the full potential of new high dynamic range (HDR) displays, a system for the enhancement of bright luminous objects in video sequences is proposed. The system classifies clipped (saturated) regions as lights, reflections or diffuse surfaces using a semi-automatic classifier and then enhances each class of objects with respect to its relative brightness. The enhancement algorithm can significantly stretch the contrast of clipped regions while avoiding amplification of noise and contouring. We demonstrate that the enhanced video is strongly preferred to non-enhanced video, and it compares favorably to other methods.},

abstract="This paper presents an automatic technique for producing high-quality brightness-enhancement functions for real-time reverse tone mapping of images and videos. Our approach uses a bilateral filter to obtain smooth results while preserving sharp luminance discontinuities, and can be efficiently implemented on GPUs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by reverse tone mapping several images and videos. Experiments based on HDR visible difference predicator and on an image distortion metric indicate that the results produced by our method are less prone to visible artifacts than the ones obtained with the state-of-the-art technique for real-time automatic computation of brightness enhancement functions.",

abstract = {Abstract In the last few years, researchers in the field of High Dynamic Range (HDR) Imaging have focused on providing tools for expanding Low Dynamic Range (LDR) content for the generation of HDR images due to the growing popularity of HDR in applications, such as photography and rendering via Image-Based Lighting, and the imminent arrival of HDR displays to the consumer market. LDR content expansion is required due to the lack of fast and reliable consumer level HDR capture for still images and videos. Furthermore, LDR content expansion, will allow the re-use of legacy LDR stills, videos and LDR applications created, over the last century and more, to be widely available. The use of certain LDR expansion methods, those that are based on the inversion of Tone Mapping Operators (TMOs), has made it possible to create novel compression algorithms that tackle the problem of the size of HDR content storage, which remains one of the major obstacles to be overcome for the adoption of HDR. These methods are used in conjunction with traditional LDR compression methods and can evolve accordingly. The goal of this report is to provide a comprehensive overview on HDR Imaging, and an in depth review on these emerging topics.},

In this paper we present a novel tone mapping algorithm that is based on K-means clustering. Using dynamic programming we are able to not only solve the clustering problem efficiently, but also find the global optimum. Our algorithm runs in {\$}{\$}{\backslash}hbox {\{}O{\}}(N^2K){\$}{\$}O(N2K)for an image with N input luminance levels and K output levels. We show that our algorithm gives comparable results to state-of-the-art tone mapping algorithms, but with the additional large benefit of a minimum of parameters. We show how to extend the method to handle video input. We test our algorithm on a number of standard high dynamic range images and video sequences and give qualitative and quantitative comparisons to a number of state-of-the-art tone mapping algorithms.",

Numerous modifications improved impulsive noise filtering efficiency and cope with video artifacts such as Gaussian, impulsive and grain noise and still preserves and even enhances edges. It can even remove block compression artifacts and video flickering. Simulations show that it performs well under PSNR and SSIM metrics. It gives particularly good results for mixed Gaussian and impulse noise---PSNR is approximately 3 dB better than VMF3D and my previous spatial filters. The new algorithm allows video processing in real time for low resolution images; in the preliminary simulations, the processing rate of over 50 fps for the CIF (CIF standard: 352 {\$}{\$}{\backslash}times{\$}{\$}{\texttimes}288 pixel) video sequences was obtained.",
